## üìù Notes

1. The Lenovo ThinkCentre M920x Tiny offers enterprise-grade features:
   - TPM 2.0 security chip.
   - Dual M.2 slots for NVMe or Intel Optane memory.
   - Onboard SATA port allows additional internal storage or eSATA conversion for external drives.

2. The Intel Core i5-8600T processor supports hardware acceleration for H.264, H.265, VP8, and VP9 codecs via Intel Quick Sync Video, making it ideal for Plex transcoding and media-related tasks.

3. The HP Nvidia Quadro K1200 GPU is used exclusively for CUDA-based tasks like facial recognition but is outperformed by newer GPUs like the Nvidia T1000:
   - The T1000 offers nearly double the CUDA cores (896 vs 512) and significantly higher memory bandwidth (~160 GB/s vs ~80 GB/s).
   - However, the K1200 is a cost-effective option at just $35 compared to the T1000‚Äôs ~$230 price point while remaining compatible with this build's riser card faceplate.

4. The M.2 A+E Intel I225-V Ethernet NIC provides fast multi-gigabit networking, enabling efficient backups to slower storage systems like a Synology NAS with spinning drives.

5. This build balances cost-effectiveness and performance while leaving room for future storage expansion through onboard SATA or eSATA options.
